    <Memorie text_left="I still remember my first website like it was yesterday. It brings back so many memories from 2010. If I were to look at it now, I would say it looks like a crazy monkey put things here and there, but that's what made it so special to me. I was just a kid at the time, barely knowing any English or much about the web. But I'll never forget the feeling of typing in my first <head> and <body> tags." text_right="My first website may have had a disastrous layout - complete with a buggy, outdated lateral menu and a background featuring my favorite anime series from when I was a kid, but it is still filled with warm, wonderful memories.

It may not have been the most polished website, but it was mine." title='My First Web' cardImg={firstWeb} url={'https://maquicosas.es.tl/Home.htm'}/>

    <Memorie text_left={`As the years passed, I decided to take web and software development more seriously. I enrolled in a national program focused on coding and software, and our first project was a group-based one. I took on the task of leading the group and working on the main layout, as well as the "ventas" section. I also created a full CRUD system in the backend. However, soon after I discovered that software development can be a true inferno. Despite the challenges, I was determined to push through and learn as much as I could.`} text_right={"As our group project progressed, things began to go wrong. The deadline for submission was approaching quickly and some members of the group failed to complete their assigned tasks, while others abandoned the project altogether. Conflicts on Git merges, which I was still learning to navigate, became a daily struggle. In the end, the project was only half-finished and die after Heroku free tier was gone. Nowadays, the web is plagued with bugs but I manage to revive it and put it online again.  Despite the challenges, I learned a lot from this experience.

    <Memorie text_left={`"Maneja tu Proyecto" Our second group-based project was unlike anything we had ever tackled before. As a web application, it offered a world of possibilities, where you could choose from three dynamic roles: admin, leader, or student. Each role was like unlocking a different door, revealing new pages and sections, waiting to be explored. Students, eager to dive in, scoured the platform for available projects, signing up and putting their skills to the test. Meanwhile, leaders took charge, creating projects with clear objectives, guiding their team to success and paving the way for new beginnings. And the admins, they held the key to this magical world, authorizing new students and leaders, approving projects and altering the state of a project. But the journey was not without its challenges.`} text_right={"Adversity struck when two members of our team faltered, leaving crucial work undone. To add to the chaos, my little brother was suddenly hospitalized with a strange illness. The project seemed doomed until a shining star emerged - my friend Hector. He courageously took on the backend, freeing me to concentrate on the front-end once my brother was on the mend. Together, we rose to the challenge and shouldered the responsibilities. Despite some bugs in the final version, we gave it our all and made it to the finish line. This experience taught me the true value of a supportive team.

    <Memorie text_left={`"Vet AnÃ¡lisis datos" is the result of my first paid work, a project that was forged from a chance meeting with a friend at a national program. My friend, a seasoned veterinarian and data scientist saw the spark in me and offered me the opportunity to embark on an incredible journey - to create a comprehensive data analysis course tailored specifically for veterinarians, in Spanish.
    We saw the need for quality educational resources in Spanish, and with a mission to fill that void, we set out to create a course that not only imparts knowledge but also inspires. With a beautiful user interface, an inviting home page, and a lateral menu that makes navigation a breeze, we designed the course to be both easy on the eyes and user-friendly. The page features a fully functional contact form, the ability to download files, and a video player for a dynamic learning experience.`} text_right={"By combining the latest technologies, such as React and Astro, we build the project in an interactive/static component-based architecture, with this we were able to create a page that loads quickly and provides a seamless experience.

This project was more than just a paid job, it was an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of veterinarians and help them harness the power of data analysis.
